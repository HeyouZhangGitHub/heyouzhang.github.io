								<strong>Abstract</strong><br \>
								
								The realization of a photonic logic AND gate, i.e. a logic AND gate that runs on photons rather than electrons, and where all steps are controlled by light, is demonstrated. In a proof-of-principle experiment, this is accomplished by exploiting photochromic molecules for monitoring the presence or absence of photons of particular wavelengths that represent the logic variables.<br \><br \>

								Using surface-templated electrophoretic deposition, arrays of polymer beads (photonic units) incorporating photo-switchable DAE molecules are created, which can be reversibly and individually switched between high and low emission states by direct photo-excitation, without any energy or electron transfer processes within the molecular system. The micropatterned array of these photonic units is spectroscopically characterized in detail and optimized with respect to both signal contrast and cross-talk. The optimum optical parameters including laser intensity, wavelength and duration of irradiation are elucidated and ideal conditions for creating reversible on/off cycles in a micropatterned array are determined. 500 such cycles are demonstrated with no obvious on/off contrast attenuation. The ability to process binary information is demonstrated by selectively writing information to the given photonic unit, reading the resultant emissive signal pattern and finally erasing the information again, which in turn demonstrates the possibility of continuous recording. This basic study paves the way for building complex circuits using spatially well-arranged photonic units.<br \><br \>

								The controlled assembly of colloid particles on a solid substrate has always been a major challenge in colloid and surface science. Here we provide an overview of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of single charge-stabilized nanoparticles. We demonstrate that surface templated EPD (STEPD) assembly, which combines EPD with top-down nanofabrication, allows a wide range of nanoparticles to be built up into arbitrary structures with high speed, scalability, and excellent fidelity. We will also discuss some of the current colloid chemical limitations and challenges in STEPD assembly for sub-10 nm nanoparticles and for the fabrication of densely packed single particle arrays.

								<strong>Abstract</strong><br \>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/TOC Universal.jpg" alt="Universal"/></span>
								Controlled nanocrystal assembly is a pre-requisite for incorporation of these materials into solid state devices. 
								Many assembly methods have been investigated which target precise nanocrystal positioning, high process controllability, 
								scalability, and universality. However, most methods are unable to achieve all of these goals. 
								Here, surface templated electrophoretic deposition (STED) is presented as a potential assembly method for a wide variety of nanocrystals. 
								Controlled positioning and deposition of a wide range of nanocrystals into arbitrary spatial arrangements including gold nanocrystals of different shapes and sizes, magnetic nanocrystals, fluorescent organic nanoparticles, and semiconductor quantum dots is demonstrated. Nanoparticles with diameters below 10 nm are unable to be deposited due to their low surface charge and strong Brownian motion (low Péclet number). It is shown that this limit can be circumvented by forming clusters of nanocrystals or by silica coating nanocrystals to increase their effective size.

								<strong>Abstract</strong><br \>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/Growth of Gold Nanorods.jpg" alt="Growth of Gold Nanorods"/></span>
								Using simultaneous, in situ optical spectroscopy and time-resolved, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we have directly monitored the seeded growth of nearly monodisperse gold nanorods using hydroquinone as the reductant. Growth of the rods is much slower than with the ascorbate ion, allowing the rate of growth along both the longitudinal and transverse directions to be independently determined. The thickness of the stabilizing CTAB layer (3.2 ± 0.3 nm) has also been extracted. We find that increasing the hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) concentration produces longer rods, while conversely, increasing the hydroquinone concentration reduces the final aspect ratio. The final number of gold rods is smaller than the initial number of seed particles and decreases in the presence of larger concentrations of HAuCl4. The SAXS data reveal an early transition from a spherical morphology to an ellipsoidal one and then to spherically capped cylinders. The growth curve exhibits at least three distinct regimes: an initial phase comprising spherical seed growth, followed by symmetry breaking and slow elongation. A third phase is marked by rapid rod growth and increases in the aspect ratio. This process is temporally well resolved from the initial symmetry breaking but typically occurs when the rods are around 6 nm in diameter using hydroquinone as the reductant. The results provide qualitative support for the “popcorn model” proposed by Edgar et al. [Formation of Gold Nanorods by a Stochastic “Popcorn” Mechanism. ACS Nano 2012, 6, 1116 1125].

								<strong>Abstract</strong><br \>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/TOC 002.jpg" alt="Vertical Arrays"/></span>
								Although many nanoscale materials such as quantum dots and metallic nanocrystals exhibit size dependent optical properties, it has been difficult to incorporate them into optical or electronic devices because there are currently no methods for precise, large-scale deposition of single nanocrystals. Of particular interest is the need to control the orientation of single nanocrystals since the optical properties are usually strongly anisotropic. Here a method based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is reported to precisely assemble vertically oriented, single gold nanorods. It is demonstrated that the orientation of gold nanorods during deposition is controlled by the electric dipole moment induced along the rod by the electric field. Dissipative particle dynamics simulations indicate that the magnitude of this dipole moment is dominated by the polarizability of the solution phase electric double layer around the nanorod. The resulting vertical gold nanorod arrays exhibit reflected colors due to selective excitation of the transverse surface plasmon mode. The EPD method allows assembly of arrays with a density of over one million, visually resolvable, vertical nanorods per square millimeter.
